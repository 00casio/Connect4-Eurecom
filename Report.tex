	\chapter{Introduction}
	The Connect 4 game is a classical and well-known game. It is often used as a mean to evaluate how comfortable someone is in it's programming capabilities. \\
	Today, we are the one evaluated on it, but with a (more like three) twist. We have to create an AI to play the game, communicate with another player wirelessly, and accept input from signs someone makes to a camera.

	This represents a four-way challenge.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First, we have to code the logic behind the Connect 4 in a way that makes it easy for the other part to integrate with.
		\item Second, our AI need to be fast, robust, and precise.\footnote{More on those terms in the dedicated section (\ref{AI_section}).}
		\item Thirdly, we have to choose some gestures, make it fast, and easy to use.
		\item Last but not least, we need to define the protocols and technologies used.
	\end{itemize}
