Criteria to judge the efficiency of the AI model

An AI at any depth must always beat a player that is always chosing a column randomly.
An AI at any depth must beat an AI which is at a depth level strictly lower than itself.
For a given depth level, the AI who starts first must beat an AI at the same depth level.
The AI without the alpha-beta pruning needs too much time to compute a move starting from depth â€¦ (To justify the need of alpha-beta pruning).
Calculate the percentage of winning of our AI against a set of random human players. (maybe)
